# Python ACT-R (In construction...)
## What is this repository?
This repository is a reorganization of tutorial of Python ACT-R. Its aim is to make the learning of python ACT-R easier. 
The python modules of ACT-R are compatible with python 2. I will add another repository for python 3 in the future.
